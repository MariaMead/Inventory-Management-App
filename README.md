## Project General Description:

- As a user, I want to quickly find specific items so that I can save time and
  avoid manually searching through the long lists of the inventory app.

- As a user, I want to create and access my own account so that I can maintain
  my personal inventory list and an organized record of everything and update it
  when there are changes.

- As a user, I want to share certain inventory lists with other users so that we
  can collaborate on managing shared inventory items.
